My understanding is this is going to be wrapping a lot of `openssl` commands and
writing to the filesystem. In general, need to work with the Let's Encrypt API
by figuring out ACME. Creating a CSR, handling challenges, writing files to the
filesystem. I probably won't try to implement any of the nice features of an
ACME client like revoking or automating -- at least initially.

I'm unsure if this will require external dependencies. If so, I'd like to use
`pipenv` to handle that. Need to figure out how to package it up so it can be
installed.

HTTP challenges are probably the easiest to support.

After doing more research & digging into the RFC some more, it seems doable.

Appears that the general strategy is probably going to be doing as little as
possible
- user creates their (Let's Encrypt) account key (which format should I use?)
- user creates the CSR (figure out all the options _required_)
- user creates the directory for HTTP-01 challenges to go

That seems reasonable in keeping a lean scope while providing something that
should work.

Looks like diafygi/acme-tiny is probably going to be a good reference. Shares
a similar scope. Appears to be Python 2 & 3 (?!) -- had no idea you could write
something across major versions like that. I'll just be doing Python 3. Sort of
toying with the idea of doing it in Node -- but I feel like I should keep doing
Python things.

This looks useful: https://medium.com/dabbler-in-de-stress/make-linux-cli-tools-756f7f7f06b3

If I want to support wildcard certs I need to use the DNS challenge. This makes
sense, but I'm unsure how involved the DNS challenge is compared to the HTTP in
terms of programming. I may default to the HTTP challenge to keep it simple,
even if that means dropping wildcard certs as a feature.

Looks like Click is a solid module to use for the CLI aspect of it.

Example clients:
- https://github.com/nuxi/acme-tiny (DNS challenge)
- https://github.com/diafygi/acme-tiny (HTTP challenge)
- https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated
- https://github.com/RalfJung/lets-encrypt-tiny
- Where's the JavaScript one I was looking at?
